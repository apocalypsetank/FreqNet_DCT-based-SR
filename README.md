# FreqNet_DCT-based-SR
This is the codebase of the paper "FreqNet: A Frequency-domain Image Super-Resolution Network with Dicrete Cosine Transform". This paper brings an intuitive, heuristic and funny idea of Super-Resolution via the supervision from frequency domain, with non-promising quality of results achieved. May this repository be a toast to the courage of the author.
